Process @tomatoes{1%can} and their juice through food mill, pulse in food processor until puréed, or purée with immersion blender. Purée should not be completely smooth, but should have no chunks larger than 1/16th of an inch. Set tomatoes aside.

Combine @extra-virgin olive oil{1%tbsp} and @unsalted butter{1%tbsp} in medium saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Add @grated garlic{2%cloves}, @dried oregano{1%tsp}, @red pepper flakes{pinch}, and a large pinch of @salt and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, @yellow onions{2%halves}, @basil{2%sprigs}, and @sugar{1%tsp}. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to lowest setting (bubbles should barely be breaking the surface), and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 1 hour. Discard onions and basil stems. Season to taste with salt. Allow to cool and store in covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
